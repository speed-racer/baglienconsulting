			<h2>What People Say</h2>
			<ul id="testimonials-container" class="slides">
				<li class="current">
					<blockquote>Aaron has transformed our projects, bringing a new level of confidence that releases will work correctly on all platforms. By introducing automated regression testing he has enabled us to release code significantly faster, and his exploratory testing skills are invaluable as we develop new features and discover how they will look and work in their final form. When he's not breaking our code, Aaron also fixes bugs! A relentless focus on quality combined with a practical, get things done attitude.
